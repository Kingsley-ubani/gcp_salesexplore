**Architecture Overview:**

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8110da-e7c6-4fa9-b11b-34052e1a9a8f)

The architecture diagram illustrates the end-to-end process of the project. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of each component:

1. **Storage**:
   - **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** is used to securely store files. GCS provides a scalable and durable solution for storing raw data files before any processing occurs. This ensures data is backed up safely and remains accessible for further processing steps.

2. **Cloud Function**:
   - A **Google Cloud Function** is set up to automatically trigger whenever a file is uploaded to the GCS bucket. This serverless function handles:
     - **Extraction**: Reading and extracting relevant data from the newly uploaded file.
     - **Transformation**: Processing and transforming the data to match the required schema and format.
     - **Loading**: Inserting the transformed data into **Google BigQuery**, a fully-managed data warehouse, which automates the data processing and eliminates the need for manual intervention.

3. **ETL Process**:
   - The **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** process manages the data lifecycle from raw to processed states:
     - **Extraction**: Retrieves data from multiple sources, including files uploaded to GCS.
     - **Transformation**: Cleans, validates, and formats the data to ensure accuracy and adherence to predefined rules.
     - **Loading**: Loads the processed data into BigQuery for efficient querying and analysis.

4. **Reporting**:
   - **Looker Studio** is used to create summary views and interactive dashboards from the processed data. Reporting features include:
     - **Key Metrics**: Visualizations and insights into crucial business metrics for performance tracking and trend analysis.
     - **Filtering**: Tools for filtering data based on various criteria to enable customized analysis.
     - **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Interactive elements that allow users to explore data at different levels of detail, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying information.
    

This description provides a comprehensive overview of how each component of the architecture contributes to the project, from data storage to reporting.
